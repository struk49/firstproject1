#my first project

Thisd is my first go at a website. i am finding the course hard to follow and understand. I have used the whiskey drop mini project as a base for my website. I have used bootstrap grid to make the site good for mobiles and a form from bootstrap. The code i used for the site are HTML5 and css. The site has three sections split into 5 rows. I also added a sign up page. I would have liked to add more pages but i ran out of time. Ther pages i like to add are a post from a blog or many posts. Github and Gitpod were used in the making of my site.
